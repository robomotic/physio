PHYSIO
------

This is a small program to read neural spike data from an analogue
source and do some simple analysis on it. It was developed to read and
display data from Tobi Delbrücks neuromorphic analog VLSI
retina/simple cell chip
(http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~tobi/friend/chip/index.html). This
compination proved to be a nice setup for classroom demonstrations.

For data acquisition, the comedi library (http://www.comedi.org/) is used, so
any comedi device may be used to fetch the data. It has been tested
with the USB-DUX.

For other drivers, the function MainWindow::timerEvent(QTimerEvent *)
in physio.cpp has to be modified to reflect the number of channels and
precision of the device.

Installation
------------

You need the following libraries to compile and run the program:

Comedi: http://www.comedi.org/download.php
QT3: http://www.trolltech.com/download/qt/x11.html
QWT: http://qwt.sourceforge.net/

Once all libraries are up and running, have a look at "physio.pro"
and modify it.

Then run "qmake", which should generate a Makefile and "make" to
compile everything. To finally run the program, you MUST have a comedi
device installed.


Running
-------

Start the program with "./physio". The top plot shows the raw data. On the
bottom, a PSTH may be plotted.

The parameters for the PSTH can be specified in the "PSTH parameters"
box on the left. In the "PSTH recording" box, a specific number of
stimulus repetitions/cycles can be specified.

The "print PSTH" button generates a postscript file of the bottom plot
tthat may be sent to the printer or saved. "save PSTH" saves the PSTH
data as ASCII file for later use with gnuplot.
